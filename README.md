This is a little C# console application I whipped up so that [Littlbowbub](https://www.patreon.com/littlbowbub) could quickly and easily replace the oven she's using in her recipes.
If you're interested in her content for The Sims 4, go get it for free from her web site which I just linked.

If you are the illustrious Littlbowbub herself, [click here](releases/tag/release) to download the app built with the code in this repo or the recipe packages I processed with it.
